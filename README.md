# HappyPlaces-App
It is a clone of an already existing app.
The App helps you rememeber happy places with photos. 
You can then easily locate and find them on the map.
It was built on Android 12 API level 31 (and will work on lower API levels) using the latest features and dependencies.
It is easy to use!
SQLite was used as a local database
